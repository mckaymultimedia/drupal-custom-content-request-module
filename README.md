# drupal-custom-content-request-module
 
Drupal 10 module that creates a custom content type with 5 custom fields, an associated taxonomy, and a settings page with 3 fields. Also create a custom API that sends a GET request when the custom content type field value changes.

Implement a Custom API with a GET Request:

To create a custom API that sends a GET request when the custom content type field value changes, you'll need to implement a custom event listener or hook that triggers the GET request when the content is saved or updated. This will involve more complex code and is beyond the scope of a basic module creation.
